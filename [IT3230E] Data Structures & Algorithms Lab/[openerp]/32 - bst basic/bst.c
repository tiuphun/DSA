/*
Each node of a Binary Search Tree (BST) T has a key (keys of nodes must be all different).
Perform a sequence of operations on a Binary Search Tree T (starting from empty BST) including:
insert k: insert a new node having key = k into T
preorder: print (in a new line) the sequence of keys of nodes of T visited by a Pre-Order traversal (elements are separated by a SPACE character)
postorder: print (in a new line) the sequence of keys of nodes of T visited by a Post-Order traversal (elements are separated by a SPACE character)

Input
Each line contains a command of three above format
The input is terminated by a line containing #
Output
Write the information of preorder, postorder commands described above

Example
Input
insert 5
insert 9
insert 2
insert 1
preorder
insert 8
insert 5
insert 3
postorder
#

Output
5 2 1 9
1 3 2 8 9 5
