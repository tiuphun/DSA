/* 
    Given two sequence a=a1,…,an and b=b1,…,bm. Check if these sequences are equal.
    Input
    Line 1: contains a positive integer T (1≤T≤10^2) represents number of tests
    Follow are T tests, each of which has the following format
    Line 1: n and m (1≤n,m≤1000)
    Line 2: a1,…,an
    Line 3: b1,…,bm

    Output
    Write to stdout T lines, each line t contains 1 if the sequences of the t-thtest are equal, 
    and write 0, otherwise.
